# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences**
- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**
- **Focusing on what is best for the community**
- **Showing empathy towards other community members**

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances**
- **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks**
- **Public or private harassment**
- **Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission**
- **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting**

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [martins@dmail.ai](mailto:martins@dmail.ai).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.
